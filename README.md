# Bus Ticket Booking System

This command-line Python script simulates a bus ticket booking system. It manages predefined routes, validates seat availability, and dynamically calculates fares based on journey distance. To use, execute `python "mini project2.py"` and follow the prompts for the route ID and number of passengers. The script will then output the complete fare details or a relevant error message.
